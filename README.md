The History App
The history app is an application that uses the user input (unsystematic or methodical age) and searches through the coded array or list to match the user input to a famous historical figure who passed away such as Adolf Hitler, Nelson Mandela, Black Dahlia, etc… The history App is a user friendly, interactive, and efficient application that runs on 95% of all devices.

The History App has a user-friendly UI (user interface) that grabs the attention of the user. My user interface consists of an edit text number, text views, and multiple buttons such as a reset button, an exit button, and lastly a generate button. The edit text number function allows for the user to input their chosen age. The text views serve as headings, subheadings, and display messages when the user clicks generate. Each button has a different function as identified by the individual names. The reset button clears the user input and display text from the lists. The exit button allows the user to exit the application. The generate button generates the search process for the age in the list and prompts the display text. The interface is intuitive and easy to use as there are clear instructions provided. This application is not only easy for students to interact with but also those who are not familiar with technology. Secondly the user interface makes use of history themed graphics such as the background of an old timepiece (or more commonly known as a watch) and old ship.

The application allows users to explore historical figures at specific ages. The age range for my application is 20 to 100. The History App is coded to only accept whole numbers and numbers in the given range. If a value is entered that does not fit the criteria an error message is displayed, if an age matches with an age in the database the given historical figure is displayed instead. If the user input age does not match an age in the list a display message of “Your age does not match any historical figure” is displayed. My application currently has 12 historical figures, but more historical figures can be added to the list with some simple coding. The 12 historical figures I used are: 

o	Black Dahila aged 22,
o	Jeffrey Dahmer aged 34,
o	Brittany Murphy aged 32,
o	Andrew Jackson aged 78,
o	Donna Summer aged 63,
o	Kobe Bryant aged 41,
o	Emily Dickinson aged 55,
o	Neil Armstrong aged 82,
o	Pierre Cardin aged 98,
o	Sir Isaac Newton aged 84,
o	Nelson Mandela aged 95,
o	Adolf Hitler aged 56.

Once The History App is running and installed on the emulator, the user will see the interface where they can then run the app. The first step for the user is to input a value into the edit text number function. Once a value fitting the criteria is entered the user can click generate and the display message will either show a match or notify the user that there is no current match in the list. Once the display message is shown the user can make the decision to exit the application or reset the application and run the loop again. This is done by clicking on either the exit button or the reset button. 

While coding my application there were many considerations to take into account. Firstly, the use of colour and size of the text. This is important as it affects the visibility and usability of the application. Another consideration of the application is where the display text view function is located. If located at the bottom of the application the user may not see the display text as the number pad will be displayed on top of the text, therefore I have placed the display text view function at the top of the screen directly under the heading to ensure visibility to all users. 

While coding the functionality of the application I had to consider how to prevent errors while running the application. Firstly, I coded a function to ensure that the application does not search through the list until the user inputs an age value. I then also coded a display error message to prompt the user to input a value. Without this present the application would run through the loop until it crashed as there is no value to find. A second error handling measure is the use of coding the application to only accept numbers instead of text values. This prevents the input of any phrases and ensures that the coded list of values can return a value when necessary. 


Throughout the developing process GitHub was used. GitHub is a coding platform that hosts users for collaborations, version control, and continuous integration. With the use of GitHub developers are enabled to easily share files for code and simultaneously provide input for the development of software. It allows developers or users to track changes to code in a web-based interface and automates testing and deployment of software. GitHub ensures that applications are robust and maintainable.

To make use of the above-mentioned GitHub actions a user must create a repository. The repository is used to store your code and a files revision history. The repository used for my application is named HistoryApp and is a private file and it includes a ReadMe file. A ReadMe file is a description of the code in the repository. To share your code from Android Studios to GitHub regularly commit and push your updated software files. This ensures that every version of the application can be seen and edited. This also allows the user to easily test the application other than on Android Studios. (Hideaki Hata, 2021)

Lastly, the use of Android Studio for this assignment. This application (The History App) was coded in Android Studio using the coding language Kotlin, which is a simplified version of the coding language Java. Android Studio is the official IDE (integrated development environment) for any android software development. Android studio has many helpful coding features such as the code editor, an emulator, a gradle build system, testing tools and so much more. These features ensure the easy use of the application and makes coding and testing an application easy to do. Android Studio allows for users to develop high quality Android applications efficiently. 
 
Android Studio has ensured that The History App is an efficient and attractive application. The Android Studio tools allowed for easy additions of buttons, text view functions, edit text number functions, and lastly an application that functions on almost all devices.
